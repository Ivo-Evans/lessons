# Review

In the last three lessons, we've covered a vast swath of information, often very fast. It would be perfectly natural to understand it in a superficial way, at the time, but not to prioritise getting it into your head and keeping it there. I know that I did that, the first time I tried to learn. I flew through a CodeAcademy HTML course, listening to German techno and having a blast. But a week later, when I tried to write a website, I had already forgotten everything: I hadn't appreciated that it's not only getting _through_ the content, but owning it, that is necessary, and that your points or progress in an _external_ system aren't a good indicator of how much you understand _internally_.

One of the best ways to learn is to test yourself in a pleasant, low-stakes environment, so I suggest you do so. I'd also recommend writing things down on actual paper - another thing proven to help you store memories - but writing it down on the computer has certain advantages too, like letting you revisit your answers from earlier in the test and edit them when new things occur to you.

Let's do the self-test in two parts.

Firstly, look at the titles of the first three lessons, and write down everything you can remember from each lesson.

Secondly, look at this list of words and try to define each one as best you can.

Not knowing the answers is ok - **no one has perfect memory** - but it is also feedback on areas to work on.

This might be difficult, but it's not punitive - it lets you calibrate, and determine where to put your efforts going forwards. The act of difficult recall is also highly effective in creating memory.

## Filling in the gaps

If you're looking to fill in gaps in your knowledge, you have two options - rereading the earlier lessons, or researching topics yourself. I would tentatively suggest the latter, for a few reasons

- there is generally a greater benefit to a second, fresh explanation of the same topic than there is to a repeated one.
- learning to research coding topics is an essential skill - even senior devs use google to answer their questions all the time.

That said, if you know there is some information in the previous lesson, and you just want to retrieve it, then by all means go for it.
